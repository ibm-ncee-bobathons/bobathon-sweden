## Generate API Credentials

API credentials are required to connect the ADK to your watsonx Orchestrate instance.

### Step 1: Access API Details

1. **Open watsonx Orchestrate**
   - Launch your watsonx Orchestrate instance (see previous section)

2. **Open Settings**
   - Click your user icon in the top-right corner
   - Select "Settings" from the dropdown menu

3. **Navigate to API Details**
   - Click on the "API details" tab
   - You'll see your service instance URL

### Step 2: Copy Service Instance URL

1. **Locate Service Instance URL**
   - In the API details tab, find the "Service instance URL" field
   - Example format: `https://us-south.ml.cloud.ibm.com/ml/v1/...`

2. **Copy the URL**
   - Click the copy icon next to the URL
   - Or manually select and copy the entire URL
   - **Save this URL** - you'll need it for ADK configuration

### Step 3: Generate API Key

1. **Click "Generate API key" Button**
   - In the API details tab
   - Click the "Generate API key" button

2. **Create API Key**
   - You may be prompted to create an API key name
   - Enter a descriptive name (e.g., "wxo-adk-bobathon-labs")
   - Add a description (optional, e.g., "API key for ADK development in Bobathon labs")
   - Click "Create" or "Generate"

3. **Copy and Save API Key**
   - **IMPORTANT**: The API key is shown only once
   - Click "Copy" to copy the key
   - **Save it securely** in a password manager or secure note
   - You cannot retrieve this key later
   - If lost, you'll need to generate a new one

### Important Notes About API Keys

⚠️ **Security Best Practices**:
- Never commit API keys to version control
- Don't share API keys in public channels
- Store keys in secure password managers
- Rotate keys periodically
- Delete unused keys

⚠️ **Key Limitations**:
- Keys cannot be edited or retrieved after creation
- Deleted keys cannot be recovered
- Check your trial terms for any API key limits

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: "Invalid API Key"

**Symptoms**: Authentication fails when adding environment

**Solutions**:
1. Verify you copied the complete API key
2. Check for extra spaces or characters
3. Generate a new API key and try again
4. Ensure you're using the API key from watsonx Orchestrate Settings > API details

### Issue: "Cannot Connect to Service"

**Symptoms**: ADK can't reach the service instance

**Solutions**:
1. Verify the service instance URL is correct
2. Check your internet connection
3. Ensure the service is provisioned and running
4. Try accessing watsonx Orchestrate in a browser first

### Issue: "Environment Not Found"

**Symptoms**: `orchestrate env list` shows no environments

**Solutions**:
- Re-add the environment following the instructions in the [env setup instructions.pdf](../env%20setup%20instructions%20.pdf)

### Issue: "Wrong Authentication Type"

**Symptoms**: Connection fails with authentication error

**Solutions**:
- For watsonx Orchestrate free trial: Use `--type ibm_iam`
- If auto-detection fails, explicitly specify the type

### Issue: "API Key Limit Reached"

**Symptoms**: Cannot generate new API key

**Solutions**:
1. Delete unused API keys from Settings > API details
2. Check your trial terms for API key limits
3. Reuse existing keys if possible
